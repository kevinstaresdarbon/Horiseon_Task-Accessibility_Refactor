# Horiseon_Task-Accessibility_Refactor


## A Simple Static Webpage for Horiseon

This is a simple static webpage for a ficticious company called "Horiseon".

It is here to fulfil my 'challenge one' duties in the edX: Front-End Web Development Bootcamp.

It demonstrates my ability to read, interpret and refactor a basic websites HTML and CSS into something more
performant and readable.

Furthermore, it shows my ability to set useful alt-text attributes to address accessibility concerns.

Finally, the git repository here showcases my ability to create, use and manage a public git repository, it's contents and its updates.

All essential skills for a budding developer!

Through this process I have consolidated some skills in making code "DRY" and learned about the importance of alt-text for images,
the methods and reasoning behind its usage.

I have also learned about the importance of using semantic tags when appropriate within the HTML structure to make it more sensible to the human eye.


## Installation

Difficulty: Very Easy :-

Clone the repository to a folder in your local machine with this code in your terminal
-->  git clone git@github.com:kevinstaresdarbon/Horiseon_Task-Accessibility_Refactor.git  <--
and then drag the index.html into your browser's url bar to run it in your browser using the file protocol.

Alternatively if you just want to view the page you can follow this link to the github pages deployment:

## Credits

The starter code at the initial commit, including the image files, HTML and CSS, was provided by the staff of edX.  
All commits after that is a refactor of the original code push by myself.  No collaboration was needed or taken on this repository and code.

I added the favicon.ico file myself but generated it using the image from this page: 
https://www.iconarchive.com/show/essential-toolbar-icons-by-fasticon/find-icon.html

I converted it to an .ico using this self-explanatory and easy to use site: 
https://www.icoconverter.com/ 

The template and advice for this README was taken from this site: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide

Guidance on the tone, style and application of alt-text on images was taken from these sites:
