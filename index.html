                <p>
                    The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                    travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                    your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                <p>
                    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                    internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                    you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                <p>
                    Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                    determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                    increase your lead generation.

                but applied id fields to ensure the understanding of each div's differences {lead, brand, cost} and applied alt attributes to the images in the aside   -->

                <p>
                    Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
                    to your website.

                <p>
                    Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility
                    for your business.

                <p>
                    As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer
                    need to advertise your page.
